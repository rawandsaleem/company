				<h3>Engineering site visit</h3>
				<p>During the visit, the engineer will evaluate the condition of your roof to ensure that it’s structurally sound. He or she will also look at your electrical panel – the grey box in your basement – to see if you’ll need to upgrade it. If you hear from an installer that they need to upgrade the electrical panel, that means that your new solar panels will require more amps of current and the ampere capacity of your electrical box will need to increase.</p>

				<h3> Ordering equipment</h3>
				<p>choosing the panels and inverters. if you’re looking for advice on equipment selection, here are some things to consider. The two primary components you’ll need to evaluate for your system are solar panels and inverters. Your installer will likely recommend a particular brand for each, and will additionally offer a few alternatives. Durability, efficiency and aesthetics are the primary factors most homeowners will use to compare the various brands (other than price).</p>
